Test of custom image implementation: 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco <wiki-image file="terry-davis-wobble.gif" placement="left" size="250">Terry A.

Code block of example image tests:
```
This aligns the image to the left side of the paragraph:
<wiki-image file="terry-davis-wobble.gif" placement="left">This is a caption</wiki-image>
text text text
[image] text
text text text

This aligns the image to the right side of the paragraph:
<wiki-image file="terry-davis-wobble.gif" placement="right">This is a caption</wiki-image>
Ex.
text text text
text   [image]

This breaks the text and aligns it in the middle:
<wiki-image file="terry-davis-wobble.gif" placement="break">This is a caption</wiki-image>
Ex.
text text text

# Server History

## Beginning

### Foundation
Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. Lorem Ipsum best not make any more threats to your website. It will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud.

### Design
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
